**Repository Overview**

Contains 3 jupyter notebooks which can either be run locally on your computer after downloading the entire repository or can be run remotely on Google Colab

1. **Contour Generator:** This notebook was designed to visualize the impact of various augmentation scenarios on a sample data. It can be run locally on your computer or on google colab.
2. **Radiomics Feature Extractor:** This notebook was designed to illustrate the workflow associated with in-silico contour generation using Torchio and feature extraction using pyradiomics
3. **Stability Analysis:** This notebook was designed to give an overall idea about the pipeline followed for the contour stability analysis
